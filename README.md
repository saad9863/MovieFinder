Overview


â€¢	The Movie Finder App is a simple React application that allows users to search for movies using the Open Movie Database (OMDb) API. Users can enter a movie title in the search bar, click the search icon, and view a list of matching movies. The app displays basic information about each movie, and users can click on individual movie cards for more details.

2.	Display Movie Results: The app displays a list of movies matching the search query, including basic information about each movie.
3.	Handle No Results: If no movies are found for the given search term, the app displays a message indicating that no such movie exists.
4.	Responsive Design: The app is designed to be responsive, providing a seamless experience on various devices.
5.	Technologies Used
6.	React: The app is built using the React library, allowing for the creation of dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
7.	useState and useEffect Hooks: React hooks are used to manage state and side effects, ensuring efficient and reactive updates to the UI.
8.	Fetch API: The fetch function is utilized to make asynchronous requests to the OMDb API and retrieve movie data.
